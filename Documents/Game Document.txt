Physics based Action Platforming game. Gameplay similar to "Risk of Rain" by Hopoo games and
"Trine" by Frozenbyte games.
Science fiction setting.

#Core Gameplay#

The core gameplay of the game is that of a 2.5D action platformer. The player will traverse platforms, fight
enemies and solve physics puzzles to navigate the environment and collect money.

#Combat#

Combat in the game consists of the simplistic directional shooting seen in platform games like Risk of Rain
mentioned above. An older game with this style of combat would be Contra. The player shoots to the left 
or right, and must line up their character vertically for the bullet fired to be considered a hit. The
player can also pick up small objects, for example a small explosive barrell, and throw it at enemies.

#Enemies#

The AI of the enemies will be limited. The two enemies I currently have planned are an Alien and an
automatic turret.

#The Drone#

The player character is followed by a small, flying robotic Drone. The player can control the Drone.
The drone can fly up to areas the player cannot reach, and can be told to hover where it is, allowing
the player to use it as a mobile platform.

#Platforming#
The player will have to climb ladders, make jumps and use their drone to surpass a series
of obstacles and reach the end of the level.
